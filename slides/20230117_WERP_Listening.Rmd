knitr::include_graphics("./plots/WERP_TP_Annual.png")
```

* Since 2008 WWEIR AGM Concentrations have been significantly increasing ( $\tau$=0.41; $\rho$-value<0.05).
* Based on limited data Wingate Canal Concentrations < Lard can Canal.
* Lard Can AGM TP concentrations increase from south to north (based on limited data).

### Downstream WQ Limits

* As detailed in *"Numeric Interpretation of Narrative Standards for the L-28 Interceptor Canal and Big Cypress National Preserve."* <sup>1</sup> a numeric interpretation of the narrative water quality standard was developed for WERP to be protective of the downstream OFW (Big Cypress National Preserve).

```{r}
data.frame(time=c("Long Term","Annual"),TP=c(13,21),TN=c(1.00,1.24))%>%
  flextable()%>%
  compose(j="time",i=~time=="Long Term",value=as_paragraph('Long-term (5-Year)'))%>%

                    "TP" = "Total\nPhosphorus\n(\u03BCg L\u207B\u00B9)",
                    "TN" = "Total\nNitrogen\n(mg L\u207B\u00B9)")%>%

  footnote(j=1,i=1,ref_symbols = " ",part="body",
           value=as_paragraph("Average geomtric mean concentraion."),inline=T)

```


Therefore, some level of treatment is needed to improve water quality in the Wingate-Lard Can-West Feeder Canal system.

### Conceptual WQ treatment projects

#### Improved/Advanced BMPs 

* **Low hanging fruit**, implement watershed/basin BMPs
  * Include Canal cleaning and improvement
   
* Identify areas of concern (i.e. old culverts) and implement site specific nutrient and sediment reduction BMPs.
  * Proof of concept - EAA BMP program
  
<br>

.pull-left[
<center><b>Pros</b></center>

* Cost effective
* Leverage state funding programs for BMP development and implementation

]

.pull-right[
<center><b>Cons</b></center>

* Willing participation
* Not going to provide complete level of treatment needed (additional projects needed)

### Conceptual WQ treatment projects

#### Concept #1 - Filter marsh

* Lard Can and Wingate Mill canal filter marsh(es)
  * Utilize land next to canals to build a filter marsh (long linear STA) along the canal.
  * Provide WQ treatment with minimal land 
  * Utilized in urban environments - Example Lee County Florida, 10-Mile Canal.

* Lard Can canal filter marsh 
  * ~ 2.4 km (~1.5 mi) between junction to Roberts/Sherrods property boundry gate

* Wingate Mill canal filter marsh
  * ~ 2.6 km (~1.6 mi) between junction to WC034TN (Inactive WQ site).

* 10-Mile Canal Filter Marsh
  * ~2 km (~1.21 mi) long project
  * ~30 meters (~ 100 ft) wide 
  * Over the last 9 years 66% and ~20% reduction in TP and TN, respectively (based on annual GM Conc.)

.pull-left[

* less intrusive than Wingate Mill STA
* Provides some level of treatment

### Conceptual WQ treatment projects

#### Concept #2 - Hybrid Wetland Treatment

* Combine chemical and wetland treatment to reduce nutrients
  * Utilized flocculents such as Alum, Polyaluminium chloride (PAC), Ferrous Chloride to reduce nutrient concentrations
  * Wetland treatment to provide additional treatment prior to discharge
  * Proof of Concept - Grassy Island HWTT and Lemkin Creek/Wolff Ditch HWTT
  
* Based on evaluation of past and ongoing pilot projects, recommend larger wetland features to improve treatment


.pull-left[
<center><b>Pros</b></center>

* Smaller footprint when compared to traditional STAs
* Potential for high level of treatment efficiency

]

.pull-right[
<center><b>Cons</b></center>
.small[
* Costly to run (i.e. pumps, flocculent, etc) and maintain (i.e. drying and disposal of flocculent material)
* Must understand water chemistry to optimize treatment without exporting flocculent material (i.e. sulfate, aluminum, etc.)
* Regional concern regarding mercury methylation (and other ecological and biogeochemical effects) due to increases sulfate load
* If treatment is not optimized, particulate aluminum (if Alum is used) can be discharged and cause downstream pH specific toxicity concerns
* Arsenic accumulation in biotia
* Still requires land
